## Overview

Silly things for Minetest. May also contain memes, puns and jokes.

Currently there are 8 unique silly things in this mod, I would list them here, but I encourage you to play the game and discover them yourself; it's more fun that way :)

Some silly things depend on certain mods for them to work. For the best experience, make sure to install all the dependencies, including the optional ones.
